            <p>The Generics Goodies Band originated in 1989 with two members, Gary "The Frog" Swanson and Ray Schnarr. With the "Frog" on keyboards and Schnarr on guitar and vocals, they needed some rhythm, they added "The Great Piersono" for drums and laughs. As time has progressed the band has evolved into a multimusical extravaganza covering music from the forties to the nineties spread over a vast range of genres from country to pop rock. The current nucleus of the band consists of Gary "The Frog" Swanson, keyboards; Ray Schnarr "Schnarsky" guitar & vocals; Ray "The Great Piersono" Pierson percussion and humor, Larry "Uncle Lar" Kuepker, drums, vocals & Chicken Suit, Marilyn, "Tape Lady." Younger saxophone, Virjean "Sweetie" Haywood, vocals John "Jonny" Loftus , Lead Guitar.
